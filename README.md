This project is just a **React** practice demonstartion.

## What is it?

Just a simple quiz. 

## Necessaries?

Yeah, you have to install:
1. NodeJS.

## How can I build it?

First of all you need to build a frontend application:<br />
1. Change directory in terminal to **src-frontend**
2. Run `npm install`*.
3. Run `npm run build`.
4. A `build` folder should appear.

*Look at Necessaries, 1. </br>

## How can I run it?
1. Just open the **index.html**.

## I need to inser some Custom Code. What should I do?
1. Change directory in terminal to **src-frontend**
2. If you need to insert JS-code (like GoogleAnalyticsAPI):

   2. Edit `index.html` file.
   3. Save it.
   4. Go to the `Step 4`.
3. If you need to edit some HTML-code:
